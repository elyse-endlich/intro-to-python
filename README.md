# Hello! Welcome to my Intro to Python repository.
This is where I keep all my projects from my first Python class, which I took in the fall of 2020.

I've cleaned up my code for showcasing, but since this was an intro class, _a lot of it has issues!_
Since this class, I've learned how to **write cleaner code**, how to **better automate my code**, 
and how to **limit the amount of stress I put my computer under**.
I still think it's important to show where I started, though!

Also, I don't have copies of some of the example files I worked on in this class, so some of this 
code is missing necessary data.
I apologize!

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
